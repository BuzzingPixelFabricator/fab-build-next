# BuzzingPixel Fabricator Build Process

FabBuild Next is a very light weight front-end build process.

It's a complete rebuild of the old Fabricator build process using only NPM scripts, no task runners like `grunt` or `gulp`. As a result, it's extremely flexible and light weight.

Instead of Less or Sass like the old version used, it uses postcss and postcss-cssnext.

The reason for calling it "Next" is because of a lack of creativity in naming things. I assume the next total rebuild in a few years will probably be called "After Next" or some such lack of creativity.

## Using FabBuild Next

To use this front-end build process, see the example project to get you started: [https://github.com/BuzzingPixelFabricator/fab-project](https://github.com/BuzzingPixelFabricator/fab-project).
